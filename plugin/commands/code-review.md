## Code review guidance

- MR/PR url: $ARGUMENTS
- **Working Directory**: Agents will check current directory first and only clone if necessary
- ALWAYS delegate review to `code-reviewer` agent with the MR/PR URL from $ARGUMENTS
- The `code-reviewer` agent will use the `avx:vcs-tool-manager` skill's `find-line` command to get accurate line numbers and generate validated links
- **Line Number Resolution**: Uses Python-based `find-line` tool (NOT git diff positions) to ensure links point to correct code
- The code-reviewer agent will provide PASS/FAIL verdict, `software-architect` agent should run in parallel with `code-reviewer`

## Before Delegating to Agents:

**1. Detect Platform**

```bash
VCS_TOOL=$(for path in $(jq -r 'to_entries[] | .value.installLocation + "/plugin/skills/vcs-tool-manager/vcs-tool.sh"' ~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json); do [ -f "$path" ] && echo "$path" && break; done)
PLATFORM=$("$VCS_TOOL" detect-platform)
```

**2. Fetch MR/PR Details and Existing Comments**

Extract MR/PR number from $ARGUMENTS (URL or number)

**GitLab** (if PLATFORM=gitlab):

```bash
# Fetch MR details
glab mr view <MR_NUMBER> --output json

# Fetch existing comments
glab mr note list <MR_NUMBER> --output json
```

**GitHub** (if PLATFORM=github):

```bash
# Fetch PR details
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json number,title,body,headRefName,headRefOid,url

# Fetch existing comments
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments
```

**3. Provide Context to code-reviewer Agent**

Pass the following to code-reviewer agent in your delegation prompt:

- MR/PR metadata (number, title, source branch, commit SHA)
- List of existing comments (if any) with their content and line references
- Request agent to verify if existing comments have been addressed in current code

## Review Workflow:

1. **Determine Review Scope**
   - Check git status to identify changed files
   - Parse arguments to see if user requested specific review aspects
   - Default: Run all applicable reviews
2. **Available Review Aspects:**
   - **comments** - Analyze code comment accuracy and maintainability
   - **tests** - Review test coverage quality and completeness
   - **errors** - Check error handling for silent failures
   - **types** - Analyze type design and invariants (if new types added)
   - **code** - General code review for project guidelines
   - **simplify** - Simplify code for clarity and maintainability
   - **all** - Run all applicable reviews (default)
3. **Identify Changed Files**
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to see modified files
   - Check if PR/MR already exists: `gh pr view` or `glab mr view``
   - Identify file types and what reviews apply

After thorough review, ask if you should write a comment on the MR/PR page.
Don't add "reviewed by", review dates in the footer of the comment.
Use the following comment template based on code-reviewer agent output (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS TEMPLATE!):

# Code Review Summary üîç

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Filename** ([FILENAME:LINE](https://gitdomain.com)):
   Issue description

---

## üü° Warnings (Should Fix)

1. **Filename** ([FILENAME:LINE](https://gitdomain.com)):
   Issue description

## üü¢ Suggestions (Consider)

1. **Filename** ([FILENAME:LINE](https://gitdomain.com)):

## ‚úÖ Verdict

**PASS** ‚úîÔ∏è - Ready for merge
OR
**FAIL** ‚ùå - Requires fixes before merge

## Post review actions

- When `code-review` is finished review process, ask me if i want to publish that comment, DON'T publish automatically!

## Template guidelines

- **Filename** - must be in bold text, not as heading
- **FILENAME:LINE** - must be a clickable link to exact line (e.g., https://gitlab.com/repo/file.js#L42). The `code-reviewer` agent uses the `find-line` command to get verified, accurate line numbers (NOT git diff positions), then generates links via `avx:vcs-tool-manager` skill.
- Link should point to the source branch being reviewed (the skill handles this automatically)
- Issue descriptions should be clear and actionable
- Only include sections that have issues (skip empty sections)
- Use emojis for visual clarity and better readability
- If all checks pass with no issues, just post the PASS verdict
