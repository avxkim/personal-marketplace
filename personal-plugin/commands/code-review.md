## Code review guidance

- MR/PR url: $ARGUMENTS
- ALWAYS delegate review to `code-reviewer` agent
- If MR/PR has notes/comments already, analyze them and verify if issues were fixed
- Use `glab` or `gh` CLI tools to fetch MR/PR details and generate exact line links
- The code-reviewer agent will provide PASS/FAIL verdict
` `software-architect` agent should run in parallel with `code-reviewer`

After thorough review, ask if you should write a comment on the MR/PR page.
Don't add "reviewed by", review dates in the footer of the comment.
Use the following comment template based on code-reviewer agent output:

## ‚úÖ Verdict
**PASS** ‚úîÔ∏è - Ready for merge
OR
**FAIL** ‚ùå - Requires fixes before merge

## Post review actions
- When `code-review` is finished review process, ask me if i want to publish that comment, DON'T publish automatically!

## Template guidelines
- **Filename** - must be in bold text, not as heading
- **FILENAME:LINE** - must be a clickable link to exact line (e.g., https://gitlab.com/repo/file.js#L42). You MUST PROPERLY get the line from diff! Use `glab mr view` command to make a deep `git diff` analysis, so you can get correct line numbers.
- Link should point to the source branch being reviewed
- Issue descriptions should be clear and actionable
- Only include sections that have issues (skip empty sections)
- Use emojis for visual clarity and better readability
- If all checks pass with no issues, just post the PASS verdict
